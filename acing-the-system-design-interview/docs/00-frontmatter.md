foreword
Over the course of the last 20 years, I have focused on building teams of distributed sys-
tems engineers at some of the largest tech companies in the industry (Google, Twitter, 
and Uber). In my experience, the fundamental pattern of building high-functioning 
teams at these companies is the ability to identify engineering talent that can demon-
strate their mastery of system design through the interview process. Acing the System 
Design Interview is an invaluable guide that equips aspiring software engineers and sea-
soned professionals alike with the knowledge and skills required to excel in one of the 
most critical aspects of technical interviews. In an industry where the ability to design 
scalable and reliable systems is paramount, this book is a treasure trove of insights, 
strategies, and practical tips that will undoubtedly help readers navigate the intricacies 
of the system design interview process.
As the demand for robust and scalable systems continues to soar, companies are 
increasingly prioritizing system design expertise in their hiring process. An effective sys-
tem design interview not only assesses a candidate’s technical prowess but also evaluates 
their ability to think critically, make informed decisions, and solve complex problems. 
Zhiyong’s perspective as an experienced software engineer and his deep understanding 
of the system design interview landscape make him the perfect guide for anyone seek-
ing to master this crucial skill set.
In this book, Zhiyong presents a comprehensive roadmap that takes readers through 
each step of the system design interview process. After an overview of the fundamen-
tal principles and concepts, he then delves into various design aspects, including scal-
ability, reliability, performance, and data management. With clarity and precision, he 
breaks down each topic, providing concise explanations and real-world examples that 
illustrate their practical application. He is able to demystify the system design interview

process by drawing on his own experiences and interviews with experts in the field. He 
offers valuable insights into the mindset of interviewers, the types of questions com-
monly asked, and the key factors interviewers consider when evaluating a candidate’s 
performance. Through these tips, he not only helps readers understand what to expect 
during an interview but also equips them with the confidence and tools necessary to 
excel in this high-stakes environment.
By combining the theory chapters of part 1 with the practical application chapters of 
part 2, Zhiyong ensures that readers not only grasp the theoretical foundations but also 
cultivate the ability to apply that knowledge to real-world scenarios. Moreover, this book 
goes beyond technical know-how and emphasizes the importance of effective commu-
nication in the system design interview process. Zhiyong explores strategies for effec-
tively articulating ideas, presenting solutions, and collaborating with interviewers. This 
holistic approach recognizes that successful system design is not solely dependent on 
technical brilliance but also on the ability to convey ideas and work collaboratively with 
others.
Whether you are preparing for a job interview or seeking to enhance your system 
design expertise, this book is an essential companion that will empower you to tackle 
even the most complex system design challenges with confidence and finesse.
So, dive into the pages ahead, embrace the knowledge and insights, and embark on a 
journey to master the art of building scalable and reliable systems. You will undoubtedly 
position yourself as an invaluable asset to any organization and pave the way for a suc-
cessful career as a software engineer.

Software development is a world of continuous everything. Continuous improvement, 
continuous delivery, continuous monitoring, and continuous re-evaluation of user 
needs and capacity expectations are the hallmarks of any significant software system. 
If you want to succeed as a software engineer, you must have a passion for continuous 
learning and personal growth. With passion, software engineers can literally change 
how our society connects with each other, how we share knowledge, and how we man-
age our lifestyles. 
Software trends are always evolving, from the trendiest programming language or 
framework to programmable cloud-native infrastructure. If you stick with this industry 
for decades, you’ll see these transitions several times over, just like I have. However, one 
immutable constant remains through it all: understanding the systematic reasoning of 
how a software system manages work, organizes its data, and interacts with humans is 
critical to being an effective software engineer or technology leader.
As a software engineer and then IBM Distinguished Engineer, I’ve seen firsthand 
how design tradeoffs can make or break the successful outcomes of a software system. 
Whether you’re a new engineer seeking your first role or a seasoned technology vet-
eran looking for a new challenge in a new company, this book can help you refine your 
approach to reasoning by explaining the tradeoffs inherent with any design choices. 
Acing the System Design Interview brings together and organizes the many dimensions 
of system design that you need to consider for any software system. Zhiyong Tan has 
brilliantly organized a crash course in the fundamentals of system design tradeoffs and 
presents many real-world case studies that you can use to reinforce your readiness for 
even the most challenging of system design interviews.
Part 1 of the book begins with an informative survey of critical aspects of system 
design. Starting with non-functional requirements, you’ll learn about many of the com-
mon dimensions that you must keep in mind while considering system design tradeoffs. 
Following an elaboration on , you will walk through how to organize the application pro-
gramming interface (API) specification to explain how your system design addresses 


<!-- PAGE 22 -->

the use cases of the interview problem statement. Behind the API, you’ll learn several 
industry best practices for organizing the system data model using industry-standard 
datastores and patterns for managing distributed transactions. And beyond addressing 
the prima facie use cases, you’ll learn about key aspects of system operation, including 
modern approaches to observability and log management. 
In part 2, ride along for 11 distinct system design problems, from text messaging to 
Airbnb. In each interview problem, you can pick up new skills on how to tease out the 
right questions to organize the non-functional system requirements, followed by what 
tradeoffs to invest in further discussion. System design is a skill set often rooted in an 
experience that lends itself well to learning from prior art and examples based on oth-
ers’ experiences. If you internalize the many lessons and wisdom from the examples 
presented in this book, you’ll be well prepared for even the most challenging system 
design interview problems.
I’m excited to see the contribution that Zhiyong Tan has made to the industry with 
the following work. Whether you are approaching the material after a recent gradu-
ation or after many years of already working in the industry, I hope you’ll find new 
opportunities for personal growth as I did when absorbing the experiences represented 
in Acing the System Design Interview.

preface
It is Wednesday at 4 p.m. As you leave your last video interview for your dream com-
pany, you are filled with a familiar mix of feelings: exhaustion, frustration, and déjà vu. 
You already know that in one to two days you will receive the email that you have seen 
so many times in your years as an engineer. “Thank you for your interest in the senior 
software engineer role at XXX. While your experience and skill set are impressive, 
after much consideration, we regret to inform you that we will not be proceeding with 
your candidacy.”
It was the system design interview again. You had been asked to design a photo-­
sharing app, and you made a brilliant design that is scalable, resilient, and maintain-
able. It used the latest frameworks and employed software development lifecycle best 
practices. But you could see that the interviewer was unimpressed. They had that far-
away look in their eyes and the bored, calm, polite tone that told you they believed they 
spent their time with you on this interview to be professional and to deliver “a great 
candidate experience.” 
This is your seventh interview attempt at this company in four years, and you have 
also interviewed repeatedly at other companies you really want to join. It is your dream 
to join this company, which has a userbase of billions and develops some of the most 
impressive developer frameworks and programming languages that dominate the 
industry. You know that the people you will meet and what you will learn at this com-
pany will serve you well in your career and be a great investment of your time.
Meanwhile, you have been promoted multiple times at the companies you have 
worked at, and you’re now a senior software engineer, making it even harder when 
you don’t pass the interviews for the equivalent job at your dream companies. You have 
been a tech lead of multiple systems, led and mentored teams of junior engineers, and 
authored and discussed system designs with senior and staff engineers, making tangi-
ble and valuable contributions to multiple system designs. Before each interview at a 
dream company, you read through all the engineering blog posts and watched all their 
engineering talks published in the last three years. You have also read every highly rated

book on microservices, data-intensive applications, cloud-native patterns, and domain-
driven design. Why can’t you just nail those system design interviews?
Has it just been bad luck all these attempts? The supply versus demand of candidates 
versus jobs at those companies? The statistical unlikelihood of being selected? Is it a 
lottery? Do you simply have to keep trying every six months until you get lucky? Do you 
need to light incense and make more generous offerings to the interview/performance 
review/promotion gods (formerly known as the exam gods back in school)?
Taking a deep breath and closing your eyes to reflect, you realize that there is so 
much you can improve in those 45 minutes that you had to discuss your system design. 
(Even though each interview is one hour, between introductions and Q&A, you essen-
tially have only 45 minutes to design a complex system that typically evolves over years.) 
Chatting with your fellow engineer friends confirms your hypothesis. You did not 
thoroughly clarify the system requirements. You assumed that what was needed was a 
minimum viable product for a backend that serves mobile apps in storing and sharing 
photos, and you started jotting down sample API specifications. The interviewer had 
to interrupt you to clarify that it should be scalable to a billion users. You drew a system 
design diagram that included a CDN, but you didn’t discuss the tradeoffs and alterna-
tives of your design choices. You were not proactive in suggesting other possibilities 
beyond the narrow scope that the interviewer gave you at the beginning of the inter-
view, such as analytics to determine the most popular photos or personalization to rec-
ommend photos to share with a user. You didn’t ask the right questions, and you didn’t 
mention important concepts like logging, monitoring, and alerting.
You realize that even with your engineering experience and your hard work in study-
ing and reading to keep up with industry best practices and developments, the breath 
of system design is vast, and you lack much formal knowledge and understanding of 
many system design components that you’ll never directly touch, like load balancers 
or certain NoSQL databases, so you cannot create a system design diagram of the level 
of completeness that the interviewer expects, and you cannot fluently zoom in and out 
when discussing various levels of the system. Until you learn to do so, you cannot meet 
the hiring bar, and you cannot truly understand a complex system or ascend to a more 
senior engineering leadership or mentorship role.

about this book
This book is about web services. A candidate should discuss the system’s require-
ments and then design a system of reasonable complexity and cost that fulfills those 
requirements.
Besides coding interviews, system design interviews are conducted for most software 
engineering, software architecture, and engineering manager interviews.
The ability to design and review large-scale systems is regarded as more important 
with increasing engineering seniority. Correspondingly, system design interviews are 
given more weight in interviews for senior positions. Preparing for them, both as an 
interviewer and candidate, is a good investment of time for a career in tech.
The open-ended nature of system design interviews makes it a challenge to prepare 
for and know how or what to discuss during an interview. Moreover, there are few dedi-
cated books on this topic. This is because system design is an art and a science. It is not 
about perfection. It is about making tradeoffs and compromises to design the system we 
can achieve with the given resources and time that most closely suits current and possi-
ble future requirements. With this book, the reader can build a knowledge foundation 
or identify and fill gaps in their knowledge.
A system design interview is also about verbal communication skills, quick thinking, 
asking good questions, and handling performance anxiety. This book emphasizes that 
one must effectively and concisely express one’s system design expertise within a less-
than-1-hour interview and drive the interview in the desired direction by asking the 
interviewer the right questions. Reading this book, along with practicing system design 
discussions with other engineers, will allow you to develop the knowledge and fluency 
required to pass system design interviews and participate well in designing systems in 
the organization you join. It can also be a resource for interviewers who conduct system 
design interviews.

Who should read this book
This book is for software engineers, software architects, and engineering managers 
looking to advance their careers.
This is not an introductory software engineering book. This book is best used after 
one has acquired a minimal level of industry experience—perhaps a student doing a 
first internship may read the documentation websites and other introductory mate-
rials of unfamiliar tools and discuss them together with other unfamiliar concepts in 
this book with engineers at her workplace. This book discusses how to approach sys-
tem design interviews and does not duplicate introductory material that we can easily 
find online or in other books. At least intermediate proficiency in coding and SQL are 
assumed.
How this book is organized: A roadmap
This book has 17 chapters across two parts and four brief appendixes.
Part 1 is presented like a typical textbook, with chapters that cover various topics dis-
cussed in a system design interview. 
Part 2 consists of discussions of sample interview questions that reference the con-
cepts covered in part 1. Each chapter was chosen to use some or most of the concepts 
covered in part 1. This book focuses on general web services, and we exclude highly spe-
cialized and complex topics like payments, video streaming, location services, or data-
base development. Moreover, in my opinion, asking a candidate to spend 10 minutes 
to discuss database linearizability or consistency topics like coordination services, quo-
rum, or gossip protocols does not reveal any expertise other than having read enough 
to discuss the said topic for 10 minutes. An interview for a specialized role that requires 
expertise on a highly specialized topic should be the focus of the entire interview and 
deserves its own dedicated books. In this book, wherever such topics are referenced, we 
refer to other books or resources that are dedicated to these said topics.

about the cover illustration
The figure on the cover of Acing the System Design Interview is “Femme Tatar Tobolsk,” or 
“A Tatar woman from the Tobolsk region,” taken from a collection by Jacques Grasset 
de Saint-Sauveur, published in 1784. The illustration is finely drawn and colored by 
hand. 
In those days, it was easy to identify where people lived and what their trade or station 
in life was just by their dress. Manning celebrates the inventiveness and initiative of the 
computer business with book covers based on the rich diversity of regional culture cen-
turies ago, brought back to life by pictures from collections such as this one.

Part 1
xxx
This part of the book discusses common topics in system design inter-
views. It sets the stage for part 2, where we discuss sample system design interview 
questions. 
We begin in chapter 1 by walking through a sample system and introducing 
many system design concepts along the way without explaining them in detail, 
then deep dive into these concepts in subsequent chapters. 
In chapter 2, we discuss one’s experience in a typical system design interview. 
We’ll learn to clarify the requirements of the question and what aspects of the sys-
tem to optimize at the expense of others. Then we discuss other common topics, 
including storing and searching data, operational concerns like monitoring and 
alerting, and edge cases and new constraints.
In chapter 3, we dive into non-functional requirements, which are usually not 
explicitly requested by the customer or interviewer and must be clarified prior to 
designing a system. 
A large system may serve hundreds of millions of users and receive billions of 
data read and write requests every day. We discuss in chapter 4 how we can scale 
our databases to handle such traffic.
The system may be divided into services, and we may need to write related data 
to these multiple services, which we discuss in chapter 5.
Many systems require certain common functionalities. In chapter 6, we dis-
cuss how we can centralize such cross-cutting functionalities into services that can 
serve many other systems.

A walkthrough of 
system design concepts
This chapter covers
¡ Learning the importance of the system design 	
	 interview
¡ Scaling a service
¡ Using cloud hosting vs. bare metal
A system design interview is a discussion between the candidate and the interviewer 
about designing a software system that is typically provided over a network. The 
interviewer begins the interview with a short and vague request to the candidate to 
design a particular software system. Depending on the particular system, the user 
base may be non-technical or technical.
System design interviews are conducted for most software engineering, software 
architecture, and engineering manager job interviews. (In this book, we collectively 
refer to software engineers, architects, and managers as simply engineers.) Other com-
ponents of the interview process include coding and behavioral/cultural interviews.
